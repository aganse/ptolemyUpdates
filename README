Dependencies: 
* ptolemy.plot (PTPlot v2.0):
  http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptolemy.plot2.0/ptolemy/plot/
----------------------------------------------------------------

These are some updated class files from the Ptolemy plot distribution
(an old one at that, this code originated a long time ago!).  Earlier
versions of these files were written by my colleague Pete Brodsky at
APL-UW, and then fairly heavily modifed by me since then so I keep
them separate from his stuff.

These updates are used by my packages RayDemo, SpheRayDemo, dataTools,
and MultiRegressTools.  So just a library package this; its files get
compiled by those other apps so the classfiles can be packaged into
their respective jar files.
